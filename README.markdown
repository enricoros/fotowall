Fotowall
========

Fotowall is a desktop APP that lets you create graphical compositions by layering
and manipulating photos and pictures, text, live video, wordclouds, and drag&drop
content from the internet. All to create a fun graphical composition with the
maximum ease of use!

Building
--------
This Fotowall package provides source code; to make an executable out of the
sources you have to know a little about programming or ask one of your friends
to do it ;-) Or just grab an 'executable package' from the project homepage.

## Ubuntu
Download Ubuntu 16.04 on a VM, then:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qt5-default qtcreator pax-utils tree -y
git clone https://github.com/enricoros/fotowall.git
cd fotowall
qmake
make -j6
./fotowall # enjoy
```
Optionally you can use 'sudo make install' to perform an installation in your system,
including showing the icon in the system menu; however you just need the 'fotowall'
executable.

## Ubuntu Static
Start by creating static qt5 development libraries. You can even use an older Ubuntu 14.04 for it, for greater compatibility.
```
wget https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.9/5.9.1/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.9.1.tar.xz
tar xpf qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.9.1.tar.xz
cd qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.9.1
./configure -static -release -prefix /opt/qt-5.9.1-static -qt-zlib -qt-pcre -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -ssl -opensource -confirm-license -make libs -nomake tools -nomake examples -nomake tests -qpa xcb -qt-xcb -opengl desktop -fontconfig
time make -j6
sudo make install
```
Then, to make the static executable follow the procedure above, replacing 'qmake'
with '/opt/qt-5.9.1-static/bin/qmake'.

## Windows Static
Start by creating static qt5 development libraries. Unpack the sources in c:\qt\src,
or you'll risk too long FS paths. First add the following 2 lines to C:\qt\src\qtbase\mkspecs\win32-g++\qmake.conf:
```
QMAKE_LFLAGS += -static -static-libgcc
DEFINES += QT_STATIC_BUILD
```
Then make sure you have mingw32 (likely installed via the Qt5 dynamic libs installer), and make
sure the SSL includes and libraries (libcrypto, libssl) are in the default paths in the mingw distro.
You may have to copy includes and libs all over the place.

Then execute the following commands in Powershell (assuming you already downloaded and patched):
```
Set-StrictMode -Version 3
$QtDir = "C:\qt\static-5.9.1"
$MingwDir = "C:\p\apps\Qt\Tools\mingw530_32"
$OpenSSLDir = "C:\OpenSSL-Win32"
$env:Path = "$OpenSSLDir\bin;$MingwDir\bin;$MingwDir\opt\bin;$env:SystemRoot\system32;$env:SystemRoot"
$env:LANG = "en"
$env:QT_INSTALL_PREFIX = $QtDir
./configure.bat -static -release -platform win32-g++ -prefix $QtDir -qt-zlib -qt-pcre -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-freetype -ssl -opengl desktop -opensource -confirm-license -make libs -nomake tools -nomake examples -nomake tests
mingw32-make -k -j6
mingw32-make -k install
# note: the following don't work yet:
# ./configure ... -openssl-linked -I $OpenSSLDir\include -L $OpenSSLDir\lib\MinGW OPENSSL_LIBS="-leay32 -l:ssleay32.a"
```
In case of problems, take a look at http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-requirements.html,
and http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/ssl.html (for -openssl-linked ).
You can now clone Fotowall, open Creator and point it to the new libraries, and make the static executable.


Sharing Ideas
-------------

I hope to expand the program as soon as I can, since there is many room for
improvement and the code is kept clean and small.

- You can join the development.. the whole stuff is done with Qt 4.5 or higher
  using the GraphicsView framework.
- And if you have any Idea or Suggestion, just drop me a line, on the project
  homepage or by mail at  enrico.ros@gmail.com ;-)

### Current Wishlist and user's requests

* Add the possibility to create a template ("like specify the elements you can readily replace (like photos and design elements)
 and specify those that are permanent.. this would be very useful for album layouting.") - assigned to Arnaud TANGUY
* Make the propeties dialog moveable/stay in the current view (reqby Martin Zimmermann, and many French users)
* Integrate Marco Bavagnoli updates on the googleimagedownloader
* Parametric "Random placement", so the image can not be rotated, for example
* Change all pictures opacity at the same time (workaround for the 'random placement' that changes opacity too)
* Font selectable - this is used for title and for frame's text
* Create a MacOS like screensaver - where polaroids fall on the background over time, one on top of the other (or mixed)
* Use the Exact size specifying the Pixel size too (carefully choose the other constraint: dpis or print size?)
* Progress dialog when loading images/{fotowall file made of many} and/or threaded loading
* Text shaking
* pop-art: pointel-ize, like krita brushes, using circles of different size
* add the undo/redo support
* canvas 'dummy' mode for taking snapshots only (shuts off video, for example)
* frame text: centered
* make uninstall
* transform pictures with a 'magneto tool' (good on grids)
* collate pictures, like autocollage, but keeping user transformations
  * blend images in one another (reqby Ruud)
* handle initial load-save after being shown. also evaluate normalized rescaling.
* frame: add bordercolor-propagating frame
* svg drawings [balloons, signs, etc..]
* masked pic
* both new and old resize&co
* webcam: on win32
* webcam: configuration panel
* templates
  * the template system could even be some auto-generated fotowall file with changing urls.
* provide some default/example files, also loadable with a short path
  * use a fotowall scene as gui (4 squared load/save/welcome/etc..)
  * scene-in-scene for 'recent files'
  * embedded examples (inside/network)
* duplicate/clone content
* real cropping
* scissors tool
  * real shaping, intersects frame shape
* integrate with a gimp-like library for effects/graphics ops
* new graphics effects (like Colorize or Warhol-ize ;-)
  * mosaic effect: from 1 picture to a grid of misaligned pics (needs re-cropping)
* update the video tutorial (still at 0.2!)
* add the "color changing stuff" to the picture themselves (req. by Contrast, Superstoned)
* win: photo dragging from the 'add picture' filedialog (seems harder that it should be. works on linux) (req. by Rossana)
* auto-placement [force field, shape, collage, etc..]
  * ap: perform rectangular image composition based on an input picture (color, pattern)
  * ap: perform image distribution based on shapes or probability sampling (on a sprayed grayscale canvas)
* 3d text
  * global illumitation/shading for shadows, frames, 3d text
* Google-suggest completion (already in, but misplaced when embedded into qgraphicsview)
* integrate kde-apps knowledgebase (already in, but doesn't work great)
* scene matrix (global perspective)
* regional links to web resources
